# Shopify Theme

## Commands

You'll primarily only use these two commands and you'd run them simultaneously in two terminals.

- `yarn dev` - Boots up webpack dev server for local development
- `yarn dev:theme` - Syncs local files to your developer theme on Shopify, watching for changes, and opens up your theme in preview mode in the browser
